#Oneweb - A fat-free CSS framework

Oneweb is a lightweight CSS framework, built with OOCSS principles in mind and an eye to maintainability, scalability and ease of customisation. It's the starting point for each of my own projects and enables me to build sites faster than with any other framework I've tried (which is a lot).

Oneweb is authored in SCSS and ticks most of the other popular buzzwords of the moment by being; mobile-first, content-driven, responsive, object-orientated, hrml5, css3, etc.

Oneweb is intended to be used by people who:

1. Understand html and css at a fairly high level.
2. Are familiar with the basics of Sass/Scss.
3. Know how to use Google to answer their questions about either of the above.
4. Have no expectation of any kind of free support from me.

## Todo
* Add a template preview image.
* Update touch icons.
* Expand mixins with my most used.
* Check compiled output, again.
