#Oneweb - A better Joomla! template

Oneweb is an exceedingly lightweight, yet flexible, Joomla template. Anything
you can design, you can build, this template will not get in your way.

Oneweb ticks most of the popular buzzwords of the moment by being; mobile-first,
content-driven, responsive, object-orientated, html5, css3, and it's built with
Sass, the only sensible choice for professionals.

##Is Oneweb right for you?

Possibly not. Oneweb is intended to be used by people who:

1. Understand html and css at a fairly high level.
2. Are familiar with at least the basics of Sass.
3. Have at least heard of Node and Grunt.
3. Know how to use Google to answer any questions about the above.
4. Understand that this software is provided ‘As-is’ and without warranty or support.
